== Installation

  sudo gem install shadow

== Usage

Shadow requires a Rails-style <tt>database.yml</tt> configuration.

Start the server with:

  shadow [path_to/database.yml] [environment] [route]

Now you can query it at:

  http://0.0.0.0:2001/route/table_name/record_id
  
You need to make RESTful HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE), with YAML form payloads for POST and PUT.
